## Geographic Cluster Analysis - Gregorian Chant 

The following analysis of Gregorian Chants is based on the study of "Genes Mirror Geography in Europe".
You can find the study here: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2008/09/01/european-genes-mirror-european-geography/

> Idea: By collecting various amounts of Gregorian Chants, these music notations can be converted to numerical values. These values are then analyzed by dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, MDS) onto two dimensions and transformed with Procrustes Analysis in order to create an estimated map. This map is then used to compare to the actual physical, geological coordinates of the churchs' locations.
